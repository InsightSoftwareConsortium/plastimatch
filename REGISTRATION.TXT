Documentation for registration

Sample file format:
------------------------------------------

## Comments begin with '#', blank lines are ignored
## A "GLOBAL" section is required, and specifies the inputs 
## and optional outputs.  
## 
## For the output files, it is similar, but not exactly the same 
## as putting them in the last stage.  
## 
## The use of xform_out is undefined when xform=vf, 
## such as demons registration.  Use vf_out instead.
[GLOBAL]
fixed=t0p_221.mha
moving=t5p_221.mha
xform_in=my_bsp.txt
vf_out=my_output_vf.mha
xform_out=my_output_bsp.txt
img_out=my_output_img.mha

## Use a "STAGE" section for each stage of processing.  
## You can get outputs (vf_out, xform_out, and img_out) if 
## you like. 
## Default values will be used for each option unless you 
## override them here.

# Quit after 50 iterations
max_its=50
# Quit if change in score differs by less than 3

# Subsample by 4,4,2 in x,y,z directions

# At the end of this stage, output the final xform
xform_out=stage_1_output_bsp.txt

## For each subsequent stage, add another "STAGE" section.
## You only need to include parameters that you want to change.
## Any unspecified parameter is inherited from the 
## previous stage.

## To run demons, set optim to "demons" and xform to "vf."

## If you want to, you can use a "COMMENT" section 
## to comment out a stage.
