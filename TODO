BUGS and MISSING FEATURES

Before version 1.0 (GPUIT B-spline support)
------------------------------------------------------
(*) Need ITK B-spline -> GPUIT B-spline converter.
(*) GPUIT B-Splines doesn't take an initial guess.
(*) GPUIT B-Splines data structure needs to keep track of image information
    (e.g. pixel size) because subsampled images in rad_registration 
    don't carry over from one stage to the next.
(*) Need GPUIT B-spline -> VF converter.
(*) Need to save GPUIT B-spline as native xform.
(*) rad_stages needs work to allow gpuit and itk demons to take advantage 
    of masks, cropped regions.

Later OK
------------------------------------------------------
(*) GPUIT B-Splines should use in mm units (currently this is converted 
    in plastimatch xform.cxx)
(*) ITK B-Splines: The linux version crashes unless an extra B-Spline 
    node is included.  This appears to be a bug in ITK.
(*) GCS Metric: This should be done as a superclass to take advantage 
    of bug fixes in ITK.
(*) Converting ITK XF to VF is slow.
(*) GPUIT B-Splines doesn't have bulk transform.
(*) Move thin-plate splines to GPUIT.
(*) Amoeba doesn't work well with rigid.
(*) RSG doesn't work well with small rotations.
(*) Command file parameter for maximum function evaluations
(*) ITK B-spline has a bug with first slice
