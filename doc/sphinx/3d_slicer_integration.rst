3D Slicer Integration
=====================

Plastimatch is available as an Extension (plug-in) for 3D Slicer.  
This is one of the easiest methods for using plastimatch, 
because it does not require using the complicated command line interface.  
Furthermore, all of the 3D Slicer Extensions are pre-compiled, and 
easy to download and use.  

Currently, there three different 3D Slicer Extensions.  They are 
documented on the 3D Slicer web site.  

* `Automatic deformable image registration <http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Modules:Plastimatch>`_
* Manual deformable image registration (not yet documented)
* `DICOM / DICOM-RT import <http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Modules:PlastimatchDICOMRT>`_
